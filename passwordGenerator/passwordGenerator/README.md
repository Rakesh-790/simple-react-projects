# React Vite Hooks Playground ðŸš€

This project is built with **React** and **Vite** and serves as a learning playground to explore key React Hooks such as:

- `useState`
- `useEffect`
- `useRef`
- `useCallback`

It is ideal for beginners or developers looking to refresh core React concepts in a modern, fast development environment.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

### 1. `useState`
Manages local state in a functional component (e.g., toggles, form inputs, counters).

### 2. `useEffect`
Performs side effects in components (e.g., fetching data, timers, DOM updates).

### 3. `useRef`
Provides a way to reference DOM elements or persist values across renders without causing re-renders.

### 4. `useCallback`
Returns a memoized version of a callback function, useful for optimization and avoiding unnecessary re-renders when passing callbacks to child components.
